# K-means Clustering for Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

**Project Description**

This project aims to segment customers of an online retail business based on their purchase behavior using the K-means clustering algorithm and RFM analysis.

RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that leverages three key customer attributes:

- Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
- Monetary Value: The total amount a customer spends.
