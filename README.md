# K-means Clustering for Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

**Project Description**

This project aims to segment customers of an online retail business based on their purchase behavior using the K-means clustering algorithm and RFM analysis.
The project involves conducting an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on customer purchase data to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on their transaction history. This analysis helps in identifying the best customers and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that leverages three key customer attributes:

- Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
- Monetary Value: The total amount a customer spends.
